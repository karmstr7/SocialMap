## Getting started with back-end:

These instructions will tell you how to get a copy of the server and running the server on a local machine or a VPS(Virtual private server). The VPS is better run on a linux operating system.

### Prerequisites for back-end:  

Required to install and run the server:

 * [python3](https://www.python.org/)
 * [python3-venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

#### Installing Prerequisites for back-end:  

##### MACOS:  

You need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first. If you already have homebrew 
on your machine, you can skip step 1.  

```
1. /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)".  
2. brew insatll python3
3. pip3 install virtualenv 
```
		
##### Ubuntu:
```  
1. sudo apt-get install python3
2. sudo apt-get install python3-venv  
```
##### Fedora: 
``` 
sudo yum install python36  
```

 Python3.4+ include the venv module on Fedora.  


### Requirements:

This is a list of requirements for the python virtual environment. These are not required to be
manually installed, as they will be installed when you run `make install` command.

* [flask 0.12.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [gunicorn 19.7.1](http://gunicorn.org/)
* [itsdangerous 0.24](https://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/)
* [MarkupSafe 1.0](https://pypi.org/project/MarkupSafe/)
* [pymongo 3.6.1](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/)
* [python-dateutil 2.7.2](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [six 1.11.0](https://pypi.org/project/six/)
* [Werkzeug 0.14.1](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/)  
* [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  

#### How to run the server:

	1. cd to the "backend" directory which contians Makefile
	2. make install
	3. make run
	4. Open the address/port listed in either the terminal or the Credentials.ini
	5. Ctrl+C to quit  

#### How to remove server:
	1. make clean
	2. make veryclean  
`make clean` should leave the project ready to run, while `make veryclean` may leave project 
in a state that requires re-running installation and configuration steps. 

## Getting started with front-end:

These instructions will tell you how to get a copy of the app and running the app on a computer or a andriod phone.
